* [Create a simple activity manually](#planactivity);
* [Create a structured activity manually](#structuredactivity);

### Types of activities in Staminity {#types}

There are two types of activities in Staminity: simple activities and structured activities. The coach and the athlete can choose a suitable option for different types of activities.

* **Simple activities. **The plan is set according to the summary indicators, and the peculiarities are described in the text.
* **Structured activities.** The activity is divided into segments. Duration and intensity are planned for each segment.

Here’s how the same activity  
“Warm up 8 km, workout 4 km with 3:45-3:50 min/km and rest 3 minutes, cool down 1 km”,  
  looks when created with segments and without them:

For structured activities the plan is calculated automatically for each segment, thus allowing the coach to promptly estimate the correctness of the athlete’s performance.

### How to plan an activity - simple activity {#planactivity}

### Plan an activity with a template {#activityfromtemplate}

With templates, you can create activities much faster. If you often complete similar activities, save them as a template in order not to waste your time when planning. Information about how to create a template you can find [here](/basics/templates.md).

The most convenient way is to drag and drop an activity from the left panel of templates to the required date:

![Cоздание тренировки по шаблону из панели шаблонов](https://content.staminity.com/assets/images/_new/activity/activity-create-from-template-ezgif.gif)

Also you can choose a template when creating an activity, but at first you need to set the required sport and category.

### Create one or several activities by copying {#copypasteactivity}

You can create a new activity by copying the one created previously.

In order to do it, mark one or several activities in the calendar and click on “Copy” in the context menu of the day or in the top panel.

Then choose the required day and click on “Paste”. New activities will be created based on the copied ones.

![Cоздание тренировки по шаблону из панели шаблонов](https://content.staminity.com/assets/images/_new/activity/activity-copy-paste-ezgif.gif)

Please note:

* you can copy only activities with a plan;
* you can copy only activities. You cannot copy events, measurements or competitions.
* when copying activities between the athletes, intensity of the activities can be recalculated based on the LT values of the athletes.

### How to create an activity for several athletes at once {#multipleactivity}

A coach can create an activity for several athletes at once. In order to do it, after setting the main parameters of the activity you need to:

* select item “Add athletes” in the context menu of the activity;
* place check marks on the required athletes;
* turn on "Recalculate based on LT" attribute, if you want the activity intensity to be recalculated for the added athletes based on their LT level;
* go back to activity.

### Planning for a group of athletes {#trainingplans}

If the coach works with groups of athletes it will be very convenient for him to use “training plans”. Detailed information about features of the training plans and about their usage you can find in the following section: [Training plans - working with groups of athletes](/basics/training-plan.md)
