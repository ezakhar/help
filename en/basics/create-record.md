# How to create an event and measurement

In addition to planned and completed activities and [competitions](/basics/competition.md), you can create the following calendar items:

* [**Event**](#event) -  an item with information about an event that is going to happen or has already happened and which is important for the training process. Examples: rest day, sickness, travel, diet, supplements, etc.

* [**Measurement**](#measurement) - an item with information about an athlete's measurements. Examples: height, weight, sleep hours, resting HR, overall feeling.

A single event is created on the date specified in the heading.  
For repeated events you may set:

**Frequency:**

* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly
* Yearly

**Repeats:**  
In the "Every" field you can set how often the event must be repeated.  
For example, for daily repeats:

* Every 1 day - an event will be repeated every day,
* Every 2 days - it will be repeated on alternate days,
* Every 3 days - it will be repeated every three days.

**Days of week:**  
In case if you have chosen weekly repeats, you can set days of week when the event will be repeated.

**Stop repeating:**  
Select when the repeats will stop:

* On date  - the event will repeat until the set date \(end date\),
* After - after a number of repeats. It means that the event will repeat the set number of times. 

#### Description:

Describe an event, give advice or recommendations to an athlete.  
Format text, highlight important things with color, insert images, links to files and videos.
