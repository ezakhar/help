# How to work as a coach in Staminity

Coach in Staminity - user of the service who can train the others. A coach can access athletes’ calendar, can plan activities and competitions for them, create events.

Options for organizing a coach work in Staminity:

* **PERSONAL COACH** - works with athletes individually, without the club. In order to work as a personal coach, you should purchase the “Coach” tariff on your own.  
  A personal coach manages his athletes independently, he can connect new athletes and drop off the existing ones.

* **CLUB COACH** - works with the athletes through a club. The “Coach” tariff is purchased by the club, you don’t need to purchase it on your own.  
  A club coach doesn't manage his athletes, the athletes are assigned to him by the management of the club.

* **COMBINING **– a coach can combine the roles of club coach and personal coach. For example, he can be a coach in one or two clubs and train personal athletes simultaneously.

## How to become a coach {#coach}

Any Staminity user can become a coach.

In order to do it, you need to enable the ["Coach" tariff](/tariffs/Coach.md) for a trial period at your own expense or at the expense of the club. Different options for registration depending on the chosen role are described in the ["Getting started"](/basics/getting-started.md) article.

If you don't have athletes, then you don't need to purchase the "Coach" tariff after the end of the trial period. Your coach profile will be displayed to the service's users in the coach search results and you will be able to purchase the tariff when you'll need the coach functions in order to work with athletes.

If you want to work with athletes, you need to enable the "Coach" tariff. If you are a personal coach, you can purchase it at your own expense and if you are a club coach - at the expense of the club.
