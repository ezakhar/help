# Clubs in Staminity

Club in Staminity - a tool which enables several coaches to work jointly.

In contrast to personal coaches who manage their athletes independently by sending them invitations or accepting their requests, in a club the athletes' requests are processed by a club administrator. It is also him who assigns athletes to coaches.

If there are several coaches in your running school or training center for triathlon athletes you should try to open a club in Staminity.

### Managing club members' tariff plans

The club management can subscribe the club members to the paid tariffs at the club's expense:

* the "Premium" tariff for athletes and 
* the "Coach" tariff for club coaches.

| Tariff | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| The "Coach" tariff at the expense of the club | It is obligatory for the user to be subscribed to the "Coach" tariff in order to have the "Coach" role in the club. If the club member hasn't enabled the "Coach" tariff at his own expense, then the tariff will be enabled at the expense of the club when he will be assigned the "Coach" role. Usually, the "Coach" tariff will be enabled automatically upon assigning the "Coach" role to the club members without any additional actions from the club management. But in some cases, it will be required to enable the "Coach" tariff manually at the expense of the club. For example, when the term of the "Coach" tariff purchased at the expense of the coach has expired. |
| The "Premium" tariff at the expense of the club | It is not obligatory to enable the "Premium" tariff for the club members. It is a possibility to provide some club members with access to the premium functions of the service. The cost of the "Premium" tariff when purchased at the expense of the club is lower than when it is purchased by the athlete at his own expense. |

**Please note! Charges for the tariff enabled at the expense of the club will be added to the club bill starting from the day of subscription to the tariff. The minimum period to be charged is one day. **

In order to enable the tariff at the expense of the club you need to:

* select the required club member \[9\],
* click on the "Tariffs" button \[6\], 
* enable or disable the required tariff for the selected club member;
* apply changes.
