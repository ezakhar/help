#How to connect with coach

It is possible to start working with coach by athlete initiative or by coach initiative. 
Available options depends on coach's role in Staminity:

* **PERSONAL COACH** - works with the athletes individually, without the club. The athletes connect to him directly. In order to work as a personal coach, he should purchase the “Coach” tariff.
Personal coach manage his athletes by himself so it is possible to make a connection:
  * [By athlete's request](#startcoach) - an athlete sends a request to coach and coach accepts it;
  * [By coach's invitation](#invite) - a coach sends an invite to athlete and athlete accepts it.

* **CLUB COACH** - works with the athletes through a club. The “Coach” tariff is purchased by the club,
Club coach is not able to manage his athletes:  they are assigned to him by the management of the club.

So start work with club coach could be possible only through club [by sending a request to join club](#joinclubrequest) or by [accepting an invitation from club](#joinclubinvite).
