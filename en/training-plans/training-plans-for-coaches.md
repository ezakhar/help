# Selling training plans in Staminity

Staminity offers coaches and clubs a convenient platform for promoting and selling training plans in cyclic sports.

**Training plan** in Staminity is a set of planned activities and recommendations of a coach, which should be completed by an athlete in order to achieve the planned goals.

## Extra income for a coach

All over the world training plans allow coaches to:

1. **earn extra income**
2. **attract new clients**

The target audience of a training plan and of a remote work with a coach partly overlap but still, they are focused on different groups of clients: the ones who are ready/can pay for a coach and the ones who can't/don't want to.

There are more athletes who use training plans than those who work with a coach online. The majority of these athletes are preparing for their first races in running or triathlon. It is a great opportunity for a coach to earn extra and offer his services.

By adding consultations or offline activities to your training plan, you receive a chance to get acquainted with your future clients and show your competences as a coach and motivator.

## It is convenient for athletes

Staminity is a professional platform designed for supporting the training process. That's why unlike a plan presented on a paper, in a spreadsheet or in a file, it is much more convenient for athletes to train according to the plan in Staminity:
