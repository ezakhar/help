All the activities starting from the set date will be uploaded to Staminity.  
Upon completion of synchronization, you will receive a corresponding notification.

**Please note! **In order to upload your activities, Staminity will need access to information about your activities in Garmin Connect. For this purpose, when you set up synchronization in Garmin, an access to the information about your activities will be provided to the connected users \(Profile settings - Privacy settings - Who can see my activities - My connections\).

If you change this setting, your activities won’t be uploading to Staminity.

### Uploading activities from Strava {#strava}

An initial synchronization will start after that. Due to the distinctive feature of Strava, only activities completed during the last three months will be uploaded to Staminity. Upon completion of the initial synchronization, you will receive a corresponding notification.

If needed, you can change the synchronization start date in settings. In order to do it you need to click on the provider and set the required sync start date.
