# Periodization schemes

**Periodization scheme** defines a set of mesocycles used in season planning. For example:

* Periodization scheme described in **The Triathlete's Training Bible by Joe Friel **includes the following mesocycles:

  * Prep, 
  * Base, 
  * Build, 
  * Peak, 
  * Race, 
  * Transition. 

* An alternative set of mesocycles within the season is presented in the **"Triathlon. Olympic distance" by I. Sysoev and O. Kulinenkov:** 

  * Recovery, 
  * Preparation, 
  * Preparation-force, 
  * Aerobic, 
  * Pace mesocycle \(LT\), 
  * Intensive, 
  * Reduce.

* Traditional approach to periodization \(**according to Matveyev, 1977, edited by V.B. Issurin**\) includes the following mesocycles: 

  * General preparation, 
  * Specific preparation, 
  * Precompetitive, 
  * Competitive, 
  * Transition. 

By default, the “Joe Friel scheme” from The Triathlete’s Training Bible is available for all users. If you want to use another set of mesocycles, you need to create your own scheme.

Information about how to create and edit schemes you will find further in this article.

When creating a mesocycle, you need to set its name and color. Add a description if needed. The selected mesocycle color will be used to visualize the training load schedule during the season and in the athlete's calendar.

### Edit or delete mesocycle

In the left context menu, you will find the list of available actions for the selected mesocycle.

You can edit only mesocycles created by you. You cannot edit mesocycles in system schemes.
